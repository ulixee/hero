# Human Emulators

> HumanEmulators are plugins that sit between your script and Hero's mouse/keyboard movements. They translate your clicks and moves into randomized human-like patterns that can pass the bot-blocker checks.

This is a major work in progress. We are trying to determine whether Human Emulators are necessary as a unique type of Core Plugin.

See `@bureau/default-human-emulator` for an implementation example.
